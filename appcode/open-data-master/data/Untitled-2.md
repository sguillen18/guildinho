M/I Home 
is looking for monitoring (Infrastructure and logs) for their CRM, Pivotal. Pivotal is running on VMware, and there is very minimal monitoring today. They looked at Dynatrace in the past, but the trial somehow took down their CRM.

Right now, timeouts on their CRM are the biggest issue. Their troubleshooting process today is that Seth gets notified of the issue, he loops in as many people as possible to the call to try and pinpoint where the issue is.

This is very inefficient and impacts internal and external customers. Looking for a centralized infra/logging tool to help them proactively monitoring and understand what is actually happening when there is an issue. Let me know if there are any questions, thanks!
